They sat by the Nepali traditional fireplace (Chulo) in the side hut and witnessed live cooking. They chatted a lot keeping their bodies warm in the organic fire.  They also looked around the surrounding villages and were enchanted with the beauty of Darjeeling hills and the local people. This is the best season, all of you are most welcome.",
